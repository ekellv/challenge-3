This is a random password generator created using javascript. When the user clicks on the red Generate Password button, they will be asked a series of questions to determine the length of their password (between 8 and 128 characters) and what sort of characters they'd like to use to create their randomized password. They can choose from lower or uppercase letters, numbers and OWASP-approved special characters. If the user chooses a length outside of the desired password range, they will be asked to choose again. Similarly, if they do not choose any of the character elements to make their password, they will be asked to choose those elements again. 

Once the password length and elements are chosen, the application will condense all of those choices into an array and randomize them to actually create the new password. Once the password is created, it will be displayed on the webpage in the ReadOnly box from the HTML file. 

Some starter code was provided, however the functionality of the password generator was constructed by me. I used two separate functions in javascript, one to define the password choices and randomize them in the password, then another to call this funcation and display the newly created password on the webpage.
